##Overview

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/ftMq5ps503w) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval part of the Udacity Deep Learning nanodegree. We use an [LSTM neural network](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) to predict the closing price of the S&P 500 using a dataset of past prices.

##Dependencies

* keras
* tensorflow

Install Keras from [here](https://keras.io/) and Tensorflow from [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup). 

##Usage

Run this using [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Just type `jupyter notebook` in the main directory and the code will pop up in a browser window. 

#Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday, March 2nd 2017 at 12 PM PST

Use the price history AND two other metrics of your choice to predict the price of GOOGL stock with an LSTM network. You can find the CSV [here](https://www.google.com/finance/historical?q=NASDAQ%3AGOOGL&ei=Xu6wWKnDAcS1jAGX6a-ACg). Metrics could be sentiment analysis from Twitter of what people have said about Google, dividends, etc.
